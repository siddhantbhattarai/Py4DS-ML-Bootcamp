    "Here are some real-world practice questions for dictionaries and lists that align with data science and machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dictionaries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Visualization:**\n",
    "   You have collected data from a survey where respondents provided their favorite programming languages along with the number of respondents who chose each language. Create a dictionary to store this data and write a program to visualize the popularity of programming languages using a bar chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   You are working on a natural language processing project and need to preprocess a large text corpus. Create a dictionary to store word frequencies, where keys are individual words and values are the number of occurrences of each word. Write a program to preprocess the text and generate this dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "   You have a dataset with information about customers, including age, gender, income, and purchase history. Create a dictionary to store customer segments based on their demographics and buying behavior. Write a program to assign each customer to a segment and analyze the characteristics of each segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lists:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning:**\n",
    "   You have a dataset with missing values in certain columns. Create a list of lists to represent the dataset, where each inner list corresponds to a row of data. Write a program to clean the dataset by removing rows with missing values or imputing missing values using appropriate techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Evaluation:**\n",
    "   You have trained multiple machine learning models on a dataset and obtained their performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Create a list of dictionaries to store the performance metrics for each model, where each dictionary represents the metrics for a single model. Write a program to compare the performance of different models and identify the best-performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Transformation:**\n",
    "   You have collected data from multiple sources in different formats such as CSV files, Excel sheets, and JSON files. Create a list of dictionaries to store the data from each source, where each dictionary represents a single data entry. Write a program to transform and integrate the data from different sources into a single unified format for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "These practice questions involve common tasks encountered in data science and machine learning projects and provide opportunities to apply Python programming skills to real-world problems."
